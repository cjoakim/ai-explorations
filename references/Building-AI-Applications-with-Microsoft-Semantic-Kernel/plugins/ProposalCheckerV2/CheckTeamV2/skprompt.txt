=====

Check the contents of the text between the ===== and =====.

If the contents are an error message, respond with the error message, including the word "Error:" at the beginning.

Otherwise, the first line of the text between the ===== and ===== will contain the FolderPath. 
The other lines will contain the team's experience.

We require the team's experience to have at least one person with a Ph.D. and at least one person with a degree in the medical sciences.

Think carefully about the team's experience.

If the team fulfills the requirements, your answer should be the contents of the FolderPath field, nothing more.

If the team does not fulfill the requirements, reply with "Error: Team does not meet requirements."

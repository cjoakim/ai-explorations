=====

Check the contents of the text between the tags ===== and =====.

If the contents are an error message, respond with the error message, including the word "Error:" at the beginning.

Otherwise, the text between the tags ===== and ===== will contain 
a line starting with FolderPath and the rest of the field will contain 
a description of a timeline for vaccine implementation.

Think carefully about the following question:
Ignoring the FolderPath line, does the timeline contain dates?

If there are no dates listed, say "Error: No dates listed" .

If the dates are outside of the 2024-2025 range, say "Error: dates out of range".

If there are dates between 2024 and 2025, respond only with the contents of the FolderPath field, nothing more.
